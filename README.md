# Gradient Matrix Extruder (GME)
Software tool used for generation of magnetically permeable RF lens models via Blender.

The program requires an installation of Blender on the computer where the tool is used. If the program is unable to locate blender automatically, the request to locate "blender.exe" will be prompted on startup.

"Input Matrix/" directory stores the ".npy" array and the script that generates it, but it is not required, as the program has the capability to browse for an array anywhere on the computer.

Pressing the "Browse" button requests for a location of a ".npy" or ".h5py" array and then shows a preview of the 3D array in two orientations.

Cells marked "Mat. A" and "Mat. B" set the index of refraction for the two filaments used during the print. It is important to re-generate the lens after a filament change to match the index of refraction used in the 3D printer. The entry inputs are interchangeable, the program will always assume the material with the higher index of refraction is the positive channel.

Cells marked "Grid" and "Layer" control the amount of divisions/voxels there are in X/Y and Z plane respectively.

Cells marked "Width", "Length" and "Height" control the final dimensions of the lens. Pressing "Enter" or "Return" with the cursor in any one of these cells will scale the other two dimensions according to the ratio of the supplied 3D array. Supplying an original scaling ratio of dimensions is not required, however, as the program supports stretching of the dimentions.

Pressing "Generate" updates "Settings.ini" file with the user-supplied parameters and open the blender file, currently named "Square Grid.blend". If the blender file is already open, the "Generate" button will only update the "Settings.ini" file.

Once the blender file is open, there is one more user input needed to generate and export the STLs. Press â–¶ in blender to run the script which could take 1-2 minutes.

The output positive and negative channels are saved in the "Output STLs/" directory, overwriting the previous files.

In the blender's scene collections panel, activate Positive and Negative collections to see the channels.

The newest version of GME comes with averaging down-scaling replacing the old method of sampling down-scaling. The down-scaling function comes with the option to enable/disable treating NaN as a zero which impacts the final average of the voxel in the cell.

Closing GME program will also close the open blender file.

"Build.bat" builds the binary executable into "dist/" directory and copies "Square Grid.blend" file into "dist/" directory.
